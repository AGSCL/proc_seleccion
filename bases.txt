Women and men have very different labour market trajectories with differences in the jobs they perform across many dimensions including occupations and economic activities, contractual types, wages, access to labour rights and benefits, and working times (Benach et al., 2007). This is referred to as horizontal and vertical segregation; the first refers to the fact that men and women tend to work in different economic sectors, the latter that within any single sector, women generally access a lower position in the occupational hierarchy (Crawford et al., 2016). This results in a number of gender inequalities in occupational health (Campos-Serna et al., 2013).

In work settings, women usually avoid asking for recognition of the good work they do, and ask less for promotions and career upgrades than their male peers
